Abstract
Background: Climate change is linked to many acute and chronic public health effects. There is growing research exploring its relationship to mental health outcomes. Costs of treating mental health conditions in the U.S. have increased over time. Objectives: We build on climate change and suicide-focused mental health research to quantify and monetize changes in suicide incidence across the U.S. in response to increasing levels of warming based on six climate projections.

Methods: We develop an integrated health impact assessment model using binned and linear specifications of temperature-suicide relationship estimates from Mullins and White (2019) in combination with monthly age- and sex-specific baseline suicide incidence rates, projections of six climate models, and population projections at the U.S. county scale. We evaluate the difference in annual numbers of suicides in the U.S. corresponding to 1°C-6°C warming compared to 1986-2005 average temperatures, and compute 2015 population attributable fractions (PAF). We use the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Value of a Statistical Life to estimate the economic value of avoiding these mortality impacts.

Results: Assuming 2015 population size, warming of 1°C-6°C could result in an annual increase of 283-1,660 suicide cases, corresponding to a PAF of 0.7%-4.1%. The economic value of avoiding these impacts is $2 billion-$3 billion (2015 U.S. dollars, 3% discount rate, 2015 income level). Estimates based on linear temperature-suicide relationship specifications are 7% larger than those based on binned temperature specification. Accounting for displacement decreases estimates by 17%, while accounting for precipitation decreases estimates by 7%. Population growth between 2015 and future warming degree arrival year increases estimates by 15%-38%.

Discussion: We provide insights into the magnitude of climate change impacts on U.S. suicide incidence. Further research is needed to quantify and monetize other climate-related mental health outcomes (e.g., anxiety, depression, addiction disorders) and to characterize these risks in vulnerable populations.
